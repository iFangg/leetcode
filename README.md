### Maximum Score From Removing Stones: Medium problem (see `medium1.js`)
After a long uni term of design principle study and more refactoring than critical thinking, in the direct problem solving sense, this problem was a good refresher for me, helping highlight that I have neglected such critical thinking for a long enough time that standard problems such as this one proved difficult again.

### Merge sorted Array: Easy problem (see `easy1.js`)
My initial intuitive solution had holes in it, I realise that my problem solving and critical thinking infact have holes in them, especially when I don't properly plan the solution out and write 2 lines of my thought process out, hoping it translates to a flawless code solution
